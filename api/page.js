        "A conversational Solana agent: you type intent in plain language — 'send 0.5 SOL to maya' — and it becomes a typed, simulated on-chain action. The safety thesis is one sentence: the agent may interpret intent, but the program enforces the envelope. Aegis, an Anchor program, validates every transfer on-chain against an owner-defined policy — signer, pause, expiry, per-transaction cap, rolling daily cap, recipient allow-list, and SPL mint/token limits — before any value leaves the vault, so a jailbroken LLM or compromised backend stays bounded by the policy, not by prompt quality. Intent is parsed (Google Gemini, or a local deterministic parser for $0 demos), recipients resolve through an off-chain address book, and each action is simulated into a proposal card showing the fee, simulation result, and Aegis verdict before you confirm. Owner actions stay wallet-signed and the backend never holds the owner key. Ships with @usepraxis/sdk, a typed Node client, and a LiteSVM enforcement test gate."
